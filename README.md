# Interviewing at QB
We're excited that you're considering QB for the next step in your career journey. This monorepo houses our candidate exercises (affectionately referred to internally as **craft demos** aka demonstrating the mastery of your craft). 

The goal of these exercises is for it to serve the interviewee and the interview team as a conversation starter, so that you may get to know your future team mates. It is a take home assignment, and you should spend no more than a few hours on it. It is **not** meant to be 100% polished and ready for customers, it is meant to serve as a way of illustrating the way you think about problem solving.
